# Linear Programming Optimization Models (Operations Research)

Applied operations research project focused on formulating and solving linear programming (LP) models for real-world economic, supply chain, and sustainability decision-making problems. The project emphasizes translating complex problem descriptions into mathematical optimization models and interpreting results to support cost-efficient and policy-aware decisions.

## Problem Context

This project addresses three applied optimization problems:

1. **International Trade & Production Optimization**  
   Modeled production, import, and export decisions across three countries with different resource availabilities, production costs, capacity limits, and bilateral trade costs.  
   The objective was to minimize total system-wide production and trade costs while satisfying national demand and export constraints.

2. **Supply Chain Profit Maximization**  
   Optimized production quantities and supplier selection for a manufacturing company sourcing multiple parts from competing suppliers with capacity and pricing constraints.  
   Additional scenarios included regulatory spending limits per supplier and the introduction of a new international supplier.

3. **Sustainability-Constrained Capacity Planning**  
   Developed capacity expansion and production planning models for a steel manufacturer facing future demand growth and environmental constraints.  
   Scenarios analyzed reductions in water use, energy consumption, and pollutant emissions, and their impact on cost and production feasibility.

In each case, qualitative problem descriptions were translated into decision variables, objective functions, and linear constraints, then solved using optimization techniques.
